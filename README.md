<h1>🌟 Dynamic Product Management System 🌟</h1>

<p><strong>A straightforward and efficient system for managing and organizing your product inventory with ease. 📦🚀</strong></p>

<h2>🔑 Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Add Products:</strong> Easily add new items with essential details. 🆕</li>
    <li><strong>Search & Filter:</strong> Quickly find and filter products by key attributes. 🔍🏷️</li>
    <li><strong>View Inventory:</strong> Display all products in an organized list. 📋</li>
    <li><strong>Update & Delete:</strong> Modify or remove product details with ease. ✏️🗑️</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive Menu:</strong> User-friendly interface for seamless navigation. 🖥️</li>
</ul>


<h2>📁 Application Structure</h2>
<p>The application is organized into the following core sections:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Controller (com.rutu.controller):</strong> Contains the core logic in the <code>ProductManagementSystem</code> class, which handles all product-related operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Client (com.rutu.client):</strong> Manages user interaction through the <code>ProductTestApplication</code> class, providing a menu-driven interface for executing actions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🖥️ User Experience</h2>
<p>Upon launch, users are greeted with a simple, menu-driven interface that allows easy management of products—add, search, filter, update, and more. Built-in validations ensure data accuracy, making inventory management efficient and reliable.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dynamic Product Management System</strong> provides an intuitive way to manage your product inventory, offering a seamless experience for developers and users alike. 🚀</p>


<h2>📂 How to Get Started</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Clone the repository:</strong> Clone the project to your local machine using the following command:
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/RutikaProjects/ProductManagementSystem.git</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Open the project:</strong> Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).</li>
    <li><strong>Run the application:</strong> Run the <code>ProductManagementSystem</code> class to interact with the inventory system and explore its features.</li>
</ol>

<h2>🌐 Planned Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Advanced Search:</strong> Add range filters for price and quantity, along with sorting options by name, type, or price.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Integration:</strong> Shift to a relational database for better scalability and data management.</li>
    <li><strong>Role-Based Access:</strong> Introduce user roles for admins and regular users to enhance security.</li>
    <li><strong>Web Interface:</strong> Build a sleek web interface with Spring Boot or AngularJS for easy access anywhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics Dashboard:</strong> Implement data analytics to track inventory trends and product performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🌟 Why This Project Stands Out</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dynamic Product Management System</strong> offers a practical approach to mastering Java while providing a robust solution for efficient inventory management and real-world application.</p>
